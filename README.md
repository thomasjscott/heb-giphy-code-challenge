# HEB Code Challenge
### Requirements:
* Design and implement a web application that allows a user to search for and save
animated GIFs to a user profile using the GIPHY API. 
* Provide users with the ability to register and login to
your application
* Provide users the ability to view their favorite GIFs to their profile. Also provide
the user with the ability to categorize these saved GIFs(ex: funny, animals, etc.). 
* User data should be stored in a database. Basic application security practices should be implemented (OWASP Top 9). 
* GIFs available on your application should be limited to a G-Rating.
